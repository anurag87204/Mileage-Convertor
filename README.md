# 🚴 Cycle Mile Converter
A tool that asks you how far you've cycled in kilometers and tells you how far that is in miles.

# 💭 What I Learned
Printing on Screen (print()): Now I can make any text show up on the screen with print().

# Getting Answers (input()): I use input() to ask users for information and wait for their reply.

*  Combining Words and Answers (strings and variables): I learned to create messages by combining text and user responses.

*  Different Kinds of Information (data types): I understand how to work with many data types like integers, floats, and strings.

# Math in Python (operators): Using operators, I can easily convert kilometers to miles.

# Making Text Look Nice (f-strings): With f-strings, I can make the text look neat and tidy, with numbers slotted into sentences perfectly.

# 👟 How to Use
*  Run the script.
*  When it asks, type how many kilometers you cycled.
*  It tells you how many miles that is.

# 🐛 Bug
